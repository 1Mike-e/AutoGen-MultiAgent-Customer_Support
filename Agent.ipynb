      "\n",
      "1. **API Key Expiration**: Although your API key worked previously, it's possible that it has expired or been compromised. Please check if the API key is still valid by logging into your CloudTech account and verifying its status.\n",
      "2. **Key Rotation**: If you've rotated your API key recently, ensure that the new key is correctly configured in your application. You can find instructions on how to rotate an API key in our documentation: [API Key Rotation](https://cloudtechsolutions.com/docs/api-key-rotation).\n",
      "3. **Environment or Configuration Issues**: Sometimes, environment or configuration changes can cause authentication issues. Please verify that the API endpoint and credentials are correctly configured in your application.\n",
      "\n",
      "To troubleshoot further, you can try the following steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Check the API documentation for any recent changes: [API Documentation](https://cloudtechsolutions.com/docs/api-documentation)\n",
      "2. Verify that the API key is correctly formatted and included in the request headers.\n",
      "3. Use a tool like Postman or cURL to test the API request with the new key.\n",
      "\n",
      "If none of these steps resolve the issue, please provide more details about your application configuration and environment, so we can further assist you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, if you're using an older version of our SDK, it might be worth updating to the latest version. You can find the latest SDK versions in our documentation: [SDK Versions](https://cloudtechsolutions.com/docs/sdk-versions).\n",
